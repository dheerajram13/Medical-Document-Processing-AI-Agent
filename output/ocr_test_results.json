Well since surgery with right-sided pain.\nTECHNIQUE:\n1.5T high-resolution imaging.\nCOMPARISON:\nComparison is made with previous MRI lumbosacral spine study dated 17 June 2013.\nFINDINGS:\nThe last completely unfused vertebral body has been designated L5 for counting purposes.\nThe conus medullaris terminates at the level of T12/L1 and this has a normal appearance. Post-surgical\nchanges with posterior interpedicular screw fixation at L4/5 with decompressive laminectomy and focal\ndistortion of the thecal sac. There is no recurrent disc extrusion. There is minimal grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4\non L5 but overall appearances have remained unchanged. There is disc desiccation at L4/5 but no significant\ncentral or exit canal narrowing is identified. Facet joint hypertrophy is also noted at this level. The rest of the\nlevels are all intact. No prevertebral or paravertebral mass lesions.\nIncidental finding of a suspected calcified uterine fibroid in the posterior uterine wall measuring 12 mm in size.\nNo prevertebral or paravertebral mass lesion.\nIMPRESSION:\nSince the last MRI examination of 17 June 2013, similar finding of post-surgical changes L4/5 without definite\nfeatures of exiting or descending nerve root impingement to account for the patient's symptoms.\nThank you for referring this patient.\nDr. Edmond How\nStaff Specialist Radiologist\nSt Vincent's Hospital .

The quality of the bowel preparation was good.\nMBS Item No.\nPositive FOBT - 32222 ; Polypectomy removal of 5 or more polyps - 32229\nExtent of Exam\n-\nThe instrument was inserted to the terminal ileum. Excellent views of the entire colon and terminal\nileum were obtained. The procedure was completed without difficulty.\nFindings\nSmall external haemorrhoids were identified. These were small and were not bleeding.\nDR Andrew FOWLER\nMBBS (Hons), FRACP, MD\nCOLONOSCOPY REPORT\nDate of procedure : 9 January 2025\nReferring doctor: Dr Naomi Heath\nAnaesthetist: Dr Timothy Nelly\nMedication: Monitored Anaesthesia Care.\nSeveral diverticula were identified in the sigmoid colon. These were small and large in size\nand were not associated with muscular hypertrophy and luminal narrowing. There was no\nevidence of mucosal inflammation to indicate acute diverticulitis.\nThree polyps were identified in the right colon. The largest of these was approximately 3-6\nmm in diameter and was sessile. Appearances were consistent with adenomatous\npolyps. These were completely removed using a cold snareand were all retrieved and sent\nfor histology.\ni\nSpecimens\ni\nDiagnosis\nTwo large peduculated polyps and one small sessile polyp were identified in the sigmoid\ncolon (approximately 15-20 mm in diameter). Appearances are consistent with\nadenomatous polyps. They were excised using a hot snare polypectomy technique and\nretrieved for histology. Prior to excision, the polyps were lifted using gelofusine, methylene\nblue and 1:10,000 adrenaline.\nPolyp(s): Three sigmoid colon polyps. Two ascending colon polyps. Caecal polyp x1 .\n1. Six colonic polyps were excised.\n2. Mild-moderate diverticular disease.\n3. Small haemorrhoids.\nRecommendation\nMrs Manea will require a repeat colonoscopy in 3-years. I have placed her in our database and will\nsend a reminder at the appropriate stage.\nAwait histological examination of the biopsy specimens taken.\nPlease arrange a follow-up review appointment with Dr George Marinos in 2-3 weeks (either a face-to-\nface or video telehealth) so as to discuss the findings of this examination, the results of the biopsies\ntaken and treatment required, as well as to review the patient's clinical condition and to outline the\nneed for any future examination or other investigations.\nDr Andrew Fowler\nPatient: Ms Shelley Lucy Manea DOB: 09/03/1950 MRN : 0000\nDOUBLE BAY\nDAY HOSPITAL\nLevel 2 Commercial\n451 New South Head Road\nDouble Bay 2028\nSigmoid colon - polyp\nSigmoid colon\nCaecal polyp\nCaecal polyp\nCaecal polyp\nTerminal ileum\nAscending colon\nHepatic flexure\nDR Andrew FOWLER\nMBBS (Hons), FRACP, MD\nCOLONOSCOPY REPORT\nDate of procedure : 9 January 2025\nReferring doctor: Dr Naomi Heath\nCaecal polyp\nCaecal polyp\nTerminal ileum\nTransverse colon\nPatient: Ms Shelley Lucy Manea DOB: 09/03/1950 MRN : 0000\n",
